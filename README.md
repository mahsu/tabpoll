===================
Intelligently predictive new-tab engine to streamline your browsing experience.

Meet tabpoll, your new Google Chrome extension that predicts what tabs you want to open before you’re about to open them. It replaces the classic Google Chrome new tab page that sports a modern dashboard featuring the time, date, and local weather. At the heart is an intelligent predictive algorithm, operating on time-frequency analysis and k-nearest neighbors. This ensures that your new tab page always remains relevant no matter what time of the day it is. Additionally, it integrates with recurring events on google calendar to understand your browsing trends and appropriately adapts its recommendations. With a weighted list of pertinent links you’re likely to visit on one side and corresponding google calendar events on the other, tabpoll is able to grasp the relationship between the two to improve upon its real-time suggestions. Don’t believe us? Download tabpoll and watch it revolutionize the way you organize your thoughts and schedule!
